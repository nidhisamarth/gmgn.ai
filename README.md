# GMGN.AI Recreation - Mini Assignment

> **Live Demo**: [https://nidhisamarth.github.io/gmgn.ai](https://nidhisamarth.github.io/gmgn.ai)

## Project Overview

This project is a pixel-perfect recreation of **GMGN.AI** (a crypto trading and wallet mirroring tool) developed as part of a 24-hour rapid development challenge. The application replicates the mobile web version of GMGN.AI with full UI/UX accuracy, including layout, colors, typography, and smooth interactions.

## 🎯 Assignment Objectives

- **Rapid Development**: Complete recreation within 24 hours using AI-powered tools
- **Pixel-Perfect UI/UX**: Match the original GMGN.AI mobile interface exactly
- **Modern Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Live, accessible web application
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete UX flow and interaction documentation

## 🤖 AI Tools & Development Approach

This project was developed using **Lovable.dev**, an AI-powered frontend development platform that enabled rapid, high-quality code generation:

### How AI Tools Were Used:

1. **Initial Scaffold Generation**: Lovable generated the complete React project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. **Component Creation**: AI-generated pixel-accurate React components based on GMGN.AI interface analysis
3. **UI Library Integration**: Automated integration of shadcn/ui components for consistent design system
4. **Responsive Design**: AI-powered responsive breakpoints and mobile-first optimization
5. **State Management**: Generated React Context providers and custom hooks for data flow
6. **Mock API Integration**: AI-created realistic data structures and API simulation

### AI Development Benefits:

- **Speed**: 10x faster development compared to manual coding
- **Consistency**: Uniform code patterns and component structure
- **Best Practices**: AI-generated code follows React and TypeScript best practices
- **Accessibility**: Built-in ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
